# MaintMinder

This is Jessica Roy's final project for MET CS 701 at Boston University.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1.

## How to run Maint Minder

From a command line:
1. Change to the maint-minder folder within the FinalProject_Roy folder
2. Run: npm install
3. As a first-time user, Maint Minder won't find any information for you. 
You can start by editing your location or vehicle information, or you can
just go directly to entering maintenance events.


## Future enhancements

In addition to the future enhancements listed in the presentation document, I
wasn't able to finish the following features prior to the deadline:

  * Attachments - Either click to add a file attachment to an event, or drag
    and drop an attachment. I never did figure out why drop was crashing.
  * Favorite tasks - I would like the user to be able to determine which 
    maintenance tasks appear as checkboxes, which appear in the lookup to
    add more, and which don't appear at all.
  * Manually entered user locations - I wanted to give an option other than 
    geolocation, but I ran out of time.

I've commented out the partial code for these features but I left the code 
in place for future use.

## Interesting lessons learned

1. Don't commit your API key to github! Whoops. That API key has since been deleted...
